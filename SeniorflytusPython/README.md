This is the python-based approach to this senior design project.

To develop on your laptop, install Linux MINT as a VM. It definitely works using Oracle's Virtual Box and Linux MINT 18.1 "Serena" MATE: http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3182

That should have python preinstalled, and the only file needed is the ps_drone.py file. This library is found at www.playsheep.de/drone
